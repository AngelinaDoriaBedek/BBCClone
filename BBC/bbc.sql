However, there has been a lack of new drugs for decades and bacteria are becoming harder to treat, as they evolve resistance to the ones we have.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMore than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that resist treatment with antibiotics.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe researchers focused on one of the most problematic species of bacteria - Acinetobacter baumannii, which can infect wounds and cause pneumonia.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou may not have heard of it, but it is one of the three superbugs the World Health Organization has identified as a \'critical\' threat.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is often able to shrug off multiple antibiotics and is a problem in hospitals and care homes, where it can survive on surfaces and medical equipment.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDr Jonathan Stokes, from McMaster University, describes the bug as \'public enemy number one\' as it\'s \'really common\' to find cases where it is \'resistant to nearly every antibiotic\'.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nTo find a new antibiotic, the researchers first had to train the AI. They took thousands of drugs where the precise chemical structure was known, and manually tested them on Acinetobacter baumannii to see which could slow it down or kill it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis information was fed into the AI so it could learn the chemical features of drugs that could attack the problematic bacterium.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe AI was then unleashed on a list of 6,680 compounds whose effectiveness was unknown. The results - published in Nature Chemical Biology - showed it took the AI an hour and a half to produce a shortlist.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe researchers tested 240 in the laboratory, and found nine potential antibiotics. One of them was the incredibly potent antibiotic abaucin.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLaboratory experiments showed it could treat infected wounds in mice and was able to kill A. baumannii samples from patients.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, Dr Stokes told me: \"This is when the work starts.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe next step is to perfect the drug in the laboratory and then perform clinical trials. He expects the first AI antibiotics could take until 2030 until they are available to be prescribed.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCuriously, this experimental antibiotic had no effect on other species of bacteria, and works only on A. baumannii.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMany antibiotics kill bacteria indiscriminately. The researchers believe the precision of abaucin will make it harder for drug-resistance to emerge, and could lead to fewer side-effects.', 'superbug_killing_antibiotic_ai.png', 'News', 0),

In 1968, she tried to take her own life.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I was afraid to put it out [talk about the abuse] because of what I would get from Ike,\" she told journalist Carl Arrington.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIke Turner, who died in 2007, always denied his ex-wife\'s claims that he abused her, and expressed frustration that he had been demonised in the media.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nThe couple met when Tina was just 17, after she saw his group Kings of Rhythm perform, and asked him to hear her sing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNot surprisingly, he spotted her star quality, making her his lead singer, choosing her stage name and lavishing her with clothes and jewellery.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey married in 1962, and Tina, who had already experienced the pain of being rejected as a child by her mother, promised Ike she \"wouldn\'t leave him\" - something she later came to regret.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I felt obligated to stay there and I was afraid,\" she told Arrington. \"I didn\'t want to hurt him, and after he beat me up... I was sitting there all bruised and torn, and all of a sudden I\'m feeling sorry for him.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Maybe I was brainwashed.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut by 1978, after a string of hits including River Deep, Mountain High, Tina decided she felt able to leave Ike. She could no longer put up with the \"torture\" of being married to him, and the impact it had on their four sons.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I was living a life of death. I didn\'t exist,\" she said. \"But I survived it. And when I walked out, I walked. And I didn\'t look back.\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nTina moved away, and had to rebuild her career, making money by singing in Las Vegas and appearing on various TV shows.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe decided to tell all in the 1981 interview, to expel some of the ghosts from her past.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Daniel Lindsay and TJ Martin\'s 2021 documentary Tina, the singer said she was so nervous about doing the interview that she asked her psychic if it would ruin her career.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"She said, \'No, Tina\',\" the singer recalled. \"\'It\'s going to do just the opposite. It\'s going to break everything wide open.\'\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nDr Walker says the weight carried by Tina\'s words carries through to today.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It is still important to hear her voice to understand how difficult it is for a woman to be able to terminate a battering relationship without getting hurt worse or killed,\" she says.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The real question is: \'Why don\'t these men let women go?\'\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nBroadcaster and sexual abuse survivor Oprah Winfrey also talks in the documentary of the importance of women speaking out in the 80s.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Nobody talked about sexual abuse, physical abuse, domestic abuse - abuse, period. Our generation is the generation that started to break the silence.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhat Tina didn\'t realise, though, was that her explosive revelations would follow her round as her career took off again, with hits including Let\'s Stay Together, What\'s Love Got to Do With It and Private Dancer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBy 1986, she published an autobiography, I, Tina, co-written with Kurt Loder, to \"get the journalists off my back\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe thought if they had all the answers from her book, they would stop asking her endless questions taking her back to such an unhappy period in her life.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut it didn\'t work.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nIn April, the singer\'s story went full circle, when Tina - The Tina Turner Musical partnered with Women\'s Aid for its fifth anniversary, ahead of Women\'s Aid\'s 50th anniversary.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFarah Nazeer, chief executive at Women\'s Aid said: \"It is wonderful to have the story of such a powerful and influential woman supporting our mission.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Tina is an inspiration, her story shows the strength of survivors and that there is hope for women experiencing abuse currently - there is both freedom and happiness after abuse.\"', 'tina_turner.png', 'News', 0),
(3, 'Thursday, 25 May', 'Jonathan Beale', 'His brother saved his life', 'Maksym had been fighting for 200 hours without a break when he was killed by a Russian sniper', '\"For eight days he did not eat, or sleep,\" his mother Lilia says. \"He couldn\'t even close his eyes for five minutes because the sniper could shoot.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere\'s a reason why she now calls Bakhmut \"hell\". It\'s the city that took the life of one son and left her only other child seriously injured.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHer one scant comfort - that one died saving the life of the other.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMaksym and Ivan volunteered to fight when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. At the time Maksym was 22 years old and Ivan just 18.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIvan, the younger brother who still carries the scars, says they were inseparable. \"He was always with me and I with him. For me, he was the dearest person.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nIvan shows me videos and photos of them together - in a trench, in a military vehicle, trying to get some rest.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAs time passes, you see two smiling, handsome young men change, gradually appearing wearier as war strips away their innocence.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nTheir last moments together were spent engaged in brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut. \"It was impossible to sleep there. We were being attacked 24/7,\" Ivan says.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe brothers\' unit was trapped in a windowless room of a building. They\'d had to punch through walls to make firing positions. That\'s when they received an order to pull back.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIvan recalls the moment before he was wounded. \"I remember I was reloading; I came out from behind a wall and there was a flash. I was paralysed and I fell.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe says he then felt the warmth of the blood flowing from his injuries to his face. He didn\'t think he\'d survive. \"I thought I was done; I\'ll bleed out and that\'ll be it.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut Maksym came running to his rescue and dragged him back inside a building for cover.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"He revived me, took out my broken teeth and began to give me first aid,\" says Ivan. That included piercing a hole in Ivan\'s throat to prevent him from choking.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIvan shares a video of his brother tenderly wiping the blood away soon after the explosion. Another widely shared clip shows Ivan struggling to walk with a gaping wound to his face, but still clutching his Ukrainian flag: a symbol of bravery and resistance in the battle for Bakhmut.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIvan has no doubts that he would have died if it weren\'t for Maksym\'s actions. \"My brother didn\'t let me die. He saved me.\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nMaksym urgently called on the radio for help. But the first medics that tried to reach him were all killed in their vehicle when it was struck by a Russian anti-tank missile. It took another nine hours before Ivan could be rescued.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd then came Maksym\'s extraordinary act of self-sacrifice. Rather than travel with his brother to safety, he volunteered to stay in Bakhmut, to lead their unit.\r\n<br><br>\r\nStill fighting there a week later, Maksym was killed by a Russian sniper.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Ukraine the funerals of soldiers are now as constant as the sound of artillery on the front line. But they\'re not all like Maksym\'s. Alongside his grieving family, the entire town of Tomakivka had come out to pay their respects.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey knelt as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery - some clasping flowers or Ukraine\'s flag. The prayers and sombre music accompanied by tears and sobbing.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nFor the past year, Maksym and Ivan\'s parents had been living their sons\' battles vicariously. Lilia and Serhii were having sleepless nights too - waiting anxiously to hear from their boys. They\'d often receive a short text to reassure them, says Lilia - \"We\'re good, mum.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut then came the news they\'d been dreading.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLilia weeps over Maksym\'s coffin before it\'s finally lowered into the ground - accompanied by a volley of gunfire. \"We still can\'t believe it. My soul is torn,\" Lilia tells me after the funeral. She says her only reason to continue living is for her younger son.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe tells me Maksym had the chance to leave with Ivan, but he would not abandon their younger, less experienced comrades.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"He\'s a hero. He\'s an angel. He\'s sunshine. He would never leave his brother even though he knew he would die himself.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nUkraine won\'t say how many lives have been lost in this war. But look around the cemetery and you soon realise the entire country is paying an extremely heavy price.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nAt the funeral, Ivan is still clutching the Ukrainian flag which he carried when wounded - signed by his comrades including his brother. The blood from his own wounds staining the blue and yellow cloth.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI ask him if he now regrets his decision to join the army. He replies: \"We understood that we might not return, but it\'s an honour to fight for Ukraine. That\'s why I don\'t regret it in any way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"My brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood.\"', 'ukraine_brother.png', 'News', 0),

That depressed turnout to just 3.5% - and facilitated the election of ethnic Albanian mayors in towns where the vast majority of people are Serbs.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nDespite the boycott, Kosovo\'s international allies had supported the elections. But they changed their tune when it became clear that the new mayors had no mandate to speak of.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBehind the scenes, they urged Kosovo\'s authorities to tread carefully, to avoid stoking tensions in the north.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTheir advice fell on deaf ears. Last Friday, armed special police forced their way into municipal buildings in three of the towns, so the new mayors could take office in person. They also removed Serbian flags and replaced them with Kosovo\'s gold-and-blue standard.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt prompted a furious response from Kosovo\'s staunchest supporters.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe EU and Nato urged Mr Kurti to step back from a clearly provocative position. But the sternest statement of all came from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe said the US \"strongly condemns the actions by the government of Kosovo\", which had \"sharply and unnecessarily escalated tensions, undermining our efforts to help normalise relations between Kosovo and Serbia\". He warned there would be \"consequences for our bilateral relations with Kosovo\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut this rebuke had little impact on Mr Kurti, who ignored the calls to de-escalate and blithely stated that Kosovo still enjoyed international support as tensions simmered over the weekend.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Serbia, Mr Vucic was ordering troops to the border with Kosovo. It was little more than sabre-rattling, as Serbia has no appetite for interfacing with the 4,000 Nato troops who guarantee the peace in Kosovo.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nThe same sentiment does not, apparently, apply to the people who were filmed attacking Italian and Hungarian peacekeepers in Zvecan.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLocals insist they were sitting on the ground in a peaceful protest. So that raises questions about who the muscular, baton-wielding men setting about KFOR and Kosovo Police personnel were representing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTensions have now eased somewhat, as the mayors have agreed not to go back to their offices for the time being.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut emotions are still running high, illustrated by Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic\'s response to the situation at the French Open tennis championships.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter winning his first-round match, he wrote a message on the glass in front of a courtside camera. \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia,\" it read. \"Stop the violence.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut until Kosovo and Serbia can reach focus on co-operation rather than recriminations, tensions are unlikely to be far from the surface.', 'kosovo_serbia.png', 'News', 1),

AI-generated misinformation could destabilise society and \"undermine collective decision-making\"\r\n<br>\r\n  3.

They would \"drive an exponential increase in the volume and spread of misinformation, thereby fracturing reality and eroding the public trust, and drive further inequality, particularly for those who remain on the wrong side of the digital divide\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nMany AI tools essentially \"free ride\" on the \"whole of human experience to date\", Ms Renieris said. Many are trained on human-created content, text, art and music they can then imitate - and their creators \"have effectively transferred tremendous wealth and power from the public sphere to a small handful of private entities\".\r\n<br><br><br><br>\r\nMedia coverage of the supposed \"existential\" threat from AI has snowballed since March 2023 when experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a halt to the development of the next generation of AI technology.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat letter asked if we should \"develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn contrast, the new campaign has a very short statement, designed to \"open up discussion\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe statement compares the risk to that posed by nuclear war.

He hasn\'t placed a bet since.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWilliams was able to save his relationship with his daughter, but there was little he could do for his football career.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOnce a promising youngster at Wrexham who shared a field with future Premier League regulars Hal Robson-Kanu and Joe Allen in the Wales Under-21 team, the sport he had loved all his life was no longer a priority.\r\n<br><br><br><br>\r\n\"I used to be the first one in at training and the last to leave,\" he says. \"But soon I was the last in and the first out.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Managers thought I had an attitude problem.

That is why it can be harder to detect - and easier to conceal.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis year, a study in the Scientific Reports journal showed about twice the level of problem gambling among top-level sportspeople in Ireland\'s Gaelic Athletic Association compared with their demographic in the general population. It followed a 2016 Europe-wide study that showed a significantly increased level of gambling problems among professional athletes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 2014, a survey revealed gambling problems running three times higher among professional male footballers and cricketers, compared with young men in the general population.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA potent combination of more leisure time, more disposable income and a strong desire to win at all costs can create an ideal environment for addictive behaviours to germinate and grow.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Some players we interviewed believe that an elite athlete\'s personality type lends itself to gambling issues,\" explains Kieran Murray - a lead author on the 2023 paper.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"They\'re competitive by nature. Gambling with team-mates increases their risk. It\'s a group activity and it\'s easy to see why they\'d want to win. If there is a gambling culture within the team, that can be detrimental.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nWilliams agrees with Murray\'s assessment.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"When a team-mate would win big and I\'d lose, that would make me want to gamble even more,\" he says. \"I was always a sore loser. I know a lot of my team-mates felt the same way.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nMurray\'s study - titled \'Predictors of adverse gambling behaviours amongst elite athletes\' - was concentrated on amateur athletes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlayers are not paid to play in the GAA, and usually balance their time on the field with either a job or higher education. What\'s more, they compete in a league in which sponsorship by a betting company is prohibited.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is a different story in English football. Even outside the Premier League, where the average salary came in at more than 60,000 euro a week in a 2019 survey, players are still well compensated. They are fully professional, so enjoy a lifestyle with plenty of downtime between intense periods of work.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nWhat\'s more, footballers in this country are bombarded with the logos and slogans of betting companies.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"They\'re everywhere,\" says James Grimes - founder of the Big Step, a campaign launched in 2019 to eradicate gambling advertising from football at all levels.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"They\'re on the high street. They\'re on the telly. They\'re on the radio. The Football League is sponsored by Sky Bet. Major stadiums and teams are sponsored by them.\"\r\n\r\nEight Premier League teams display gambling firms on the front of their shirts this season, while two more wear betting-related adverts on their sleeves.\r\n\r\nBrentford, who have South African gambling company Hollywoodbets as their most prominent sponsor, are spearheaded on the field by Ivan Toney. The England striker, who is serving w an eight-month ban for breaching betting rules 232 times, has been diagnosed with a gambling addiction.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe contrast between his suspension and addiction, and his team\'s sponsor, has drawn attention.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It\'s rank hypocrisy,\" says Grimes. \"These young men are forced to become walking billboards for online casinos and then lose their jobs if they use that product. It\'s nonsense.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"In a perverse way this could be our tipping point. Brentford manager Thomas Frank said that something needed to change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I think that was the first time a Premier League manager has said what we\'ve been saying for years. Maybe this might prove to be a catalyst for something actually being done.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nChange has come. Rather, change will come in 2026 when gambling companies will no longer be allowed on the front of top-flight teams\' shirts after a ground-breaking agreement between clubs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGrimes called the move \"incoherent\", pointing out gambling companies will still be able to occupy the players\' sleeves, pitchside hoardings, stadium floodlight pylons and the airwaves between the action.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut the shirt-front ban is an acknowledgment of the adverse effects of the sport\'s close relationship with a product that has the potential to cause harm.\r\n<br><br>\r\nParallels have been drawn with tobacco adverts, which were outlawed in the UK in 2003.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA study carried out three years later found the ban had \"significantly reduced exposure to pro-tobacco marketing influences\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nWould a ban on gambling sponsorship act as a silver bullet? Grimes isn\'t so sure.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It would certainly help prevent harm,\" he says, \"but it wouldn\'t work by itself. That is why we also advocate to make the product safer, and to have independent money for research and treatment.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nGrimes speaks with a zealous fervour. He says he is compelled by a \"mission\" and is \"angry\" at football and an industry that let him down.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen he was 16, he placed a 5 euro accumulator on four teams and took home 90 euro when they all won. He can still remember the clubs - Histon, Stevenage, Peterborough and Torquay.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I thought I had football figured out,\" he says.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It was around this time I took an interest in coaching. I was Uefa qualified by the time I was 17. I worked in academies at Sheffield United and Doncaster Rovers. Football was my life. I trusted it with my heart and soul.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nHis bets grew larger. So did the money he owed to friends and family members, as well as to \"dodgy companies that no longer exist\". In total he lost about 100,000 euros.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe struggled to hold down a job. Once, with nowhere else to go, he spent several nights sleeping in a train station.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I\'m lucky I didn\'t take my life because I so easily could have,\" he says. \"I was on the brink of doing something really terrible. I don\'t think people realise that this is an addiction that can kill people.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I\'ve spoken to parents who lost kids to gambling-related suicide. They\'ve read the suicide notes and gambling is often cited as the primary factor. When we view this as a risk to life then we\'ll have better safety measures, but we\'re a long way away from that.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nGrimes believes education lies at the heart of a solution. So does Williams, who is now contracted with Epic Risk Management - a private consulting firm that uses the lived experience of athletes with gambling problems to inform others. Leading Premier League clubs, including Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea, have used their services.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I\'ll speak to a room of footballers and they\'ll relate to the stories I share,\" Williams explains. \"It can get emotional sometimes.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"I\'m in rooms with household names and you can hear a pin drop. They\'ll recognise the characters and the emotions and the pressures I speak about. Even if they\'re playing at a higher level than I reached, the themes are the same. I now feel like I\'m enough.\"\r\n<br><br><br><br>\r\nEveryone interviewed for this piece agreed on one important aspect - that gambling addiction is a mental health problem that should also be seen as a cost to society. A white paper published on 27 April has at least brought the conversation to those with power to make a difference.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the biggest shake-up of regulation in the gambling sector for nearly 20 years, various measures have been suggested. Limits on slot machines for 18 to 24-year-olds - \"a particularly vulnerable cohort\", according to the paper - have been proposed.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther regulations would also mean gamblers losing large amounts of money could face checks. They would kick in when a gambler loses 1,000 euro in 24 hours, or 2,000 euro over 90 days.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe measures are aimed at those already in the grip of addiction. But some argue the impressionable fan or wealthy young player with money to burn and time are still vulnerable.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The later you introduce a product to someone, the less chance they have of becoming addicted,\" Grimes says.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Kids as young as nine or 10 are exposed to this. Unless we kick gambling out of our sport for good, we\'ll be dealing with this problem for generations to come.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nTitle graphic: Nathalie Lees\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article you can visit the BBC\'s Action Line for information and support.', 'gambling_addiction.png', 'Sport', 0),

It was exciting to be there right at the start and see it take off the way it did, but it was also where my career ended, and not in the way I wanted it to.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nThe first I heard about any interest from Japan was in March 1991 when Grampus Eight faxed my agent and my club, Tottenham, about the possibility of signing me, but nothing really progressed until June, when I went to Tokyo with Spurs to play in a friendly.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat was the start of discussions which led to me being offered a two-year contract to come and play in the new J-League, which was replacing an amateur league made up of corporate teams - Grampus Eight were formerly known as Toyota Motors, and were still being bankrolled by them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe opportunity came at the right time because I was already thinking a lot about my future. I was almost 31 and had always wanted to go out of English football at the top, so I was planning to retire when my Spurs contract finished in 1993.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen the Japanese came in and we thought: \"Well, this is something completely different.\" Obviously it was a big pay-day but I\'d always been interested in travelling and experiencing other cultures after playing in Barcelona and this seemed like a really nice way to end my career, in a country that had always fascinated me and would also be safe for my family.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn\'t want to just go gradually downhill in England, which I already felt like I was on the brink of doing because I knew my powers were waning, so it appealed for footballing reasons too. I thought I could go out there and still score a few goals and it all will be really positive.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat was the plan, and the only thing that went wrong with it was when I got injured - although the news we got about my baby son George later that year meant we almost didn\'t go to Japan at all.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nWhen we arrived in Nagoya, which is around 160 miles south-west of Tokyo, in March 1993, I could tell a taxi where to go, or ring up and book a table in a restaurant and order a meal - but I couldn\'t sit down and have a proper conversation with someone. I\'d found understanding it far more difficult than Spanish had been.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat didn\'t really affect things football-wise, because there were always translators around the team. Otherwise it would have been tricky, but what tends to happen in language anyway is that you learn most of the words you need for your particular walk of life, whatever job you are doing, so I picked up all the footballing terms very quickly.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA lot of them were quite anglicised anyway - offside is ofusaido, good save is naisukipa and good shot is naisushotto. You heard that last one all the time and it used to make me chuckle sometimes, because hearing it spoken in a Japanese manner was quite amusing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere were a few players at Grampus Eight who spoke excellent English too, like our Dutch keeper Dido Havenaar, who was a lovely guy and became a good friend. But, apart from a few Brazilians, there were not many other foreign players at any of the teams.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat was because the Japanese had learned from what happened in the United States and Canada the first time they tried to launch a professional league in the 1970s, when the North American Soccer League was overwhelmed by imported stars and only lasted a few years before folding.\r\n<br><br>\r\nInstead, Japan only picked a few big-name players - myself, Brazil legend Zico and Germany\'s World Cup-winning midfielder Pierre Littbarski - to sign up and publicise it, which was very sensible. Planning everything meticulously is seen as a Japanese trait, and they did that with everything around the J-League too.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nThe way they were marketing the J-League meant I also did lots of Japanese TV commercials, which were fun. Whether they were for cars, banks, soft drinks or anything else, I think every single advert I did involved an overhead kick, which they seemed to be obsessed with at the time. I suspect it\'s moved on a bit since then, but there are probably a few Japanese people who grew up wrongly thinking that was my signature finish.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEverywhere you went, the game was booming and the level of interest was incredible, especially when you consider how tiny it had been in Japan even just before the J-League started. Baseball was the big thing, but football was also behind rugby and all sorts of their own sports, like sumo wrestling, in terms of popularity.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTheir mission had been to change that and, because it was a completely new sport, they were able to innovate to cater for their target audience, which was people under 30. For example, they introduced sudden-death extra time and penalty shootouts to decide J-League matches.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDraws are part of our game, so for me that part was a bit strange, but I understand why they did it and, overall, everything they tried seemed to work. Every game was completely sold out, including our first one, which was away at Zico\'s team, Kashima Antlers.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe weren\'t a very good side, which became more and more apparent as the season went on, but that was probably the worst game I played in and it was certainly the most one-sided. Zico had just turned 40 but he was absolutely unbelievable that day, with a brilliant hat-trick including a superb free-kick into the top corner.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey absolutely hammered us and I don\'t think I got a single chance in front of goal, which was annoying to say the least. That lack of service continued to be a problem and I only scored one goal in my first six games, but far worse was to come.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI had gone there to promote the league as much as to play in it, which was just as well considering what happened.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nI\'d first injured the big toe on my right foot playing for Spurs halfway through my final season in England. It was towards the end of the second leg of a European tie, we were comfortably ahead on aggregate and I\'d been playing a lot of games for club and country so I\'d asked Peter Shreeves to take me off for a rest.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe kept saying \"give me two more minutes\" and that turned into five minutes, and then 10. A ball was played through and I thought I could just nick it ahead of the keeper, and I did? but, as I slid out, his foot came through and crushed my toe.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI played for the rest of that season, in constant agony I have to say, and on pain killers to get me through it. Then I had an operation in the October before I headed out to Japan. It didn\'t improve things much but I was able to trundle along in training and get through matches - I played the first few games of the J-League season.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut I was starting to get shooting pain in the toe next to it, which felt weird. I mentioned it to the club doctors and they did some X-rays but they said they couldn\'t see anything. They just said it might be a damaged tendon or something, and that they would give me a little injection to play.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nSo, for the next game I had a pain-killing injection in it and I was fine for about 40 minutes or so but then my entire right foot just kind of went into spasm. There was no pain but it clenched up, like a claw.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was the weirdest sensation I\'d ever had but I made it through to half-time and I was sitting in the dressing room thinking: \"What the hell is this about?\" It didn\'t take long to find out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJust before we went out for the second half it started to hurt, when I got on to the pitch there was more pain and then pretty quickly I was in absolute hellish agony and I had to come off, on 46 minutes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI went to the hospital for some more X-rays and it turned out the toe that they had just injected had actually snapped; it was completely broken and the bone had to be screwed back together.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen it started, there was a risk that it would just be a fad but when I look at Japanese football now, I see a success story that began 30 years ago and continues to grow to this day.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe J-League has expanded so it now has 28 teams in two divisions and continues to be hugely popular with fans, but the game there has progressed in many other ways too.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTheir players were technically sound when I was there, and always worked very hard, but they had only just turned professional so you could understand why they were maybe a little fragile mentally, and lacked the tactical awareness or toughness you saw in more established leagues.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat is certainly not the case now. Their top players are in demand, globally, playing at clubs all over the world and helping the international team make a real impact as well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJapan co-hosted the 2002 men\'s World Cup, which was another of their aims when they started out, and the men\'s national team has played at all seven finals since 1998, after failing to qualify once before then. Their women\'s side is currently the leading side in Asia too.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI played no part in any of that success but it is great to see because I still have a real affinity with the country and its culture, and so do my family. Harry was born there and we still call him Harry chan now, which is a Japanese term of endearment.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe is very proud of his connection with Japan and it means a lot to him - when Leicester won the Premier League in 2016 his favourite player was Shinji Okazaki and he wore his shirt every time he watched a match.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOur neighbours in the little apartment where we lived in Nagoya had ended up becoming his godparents, and last year he went back to visit them, and go back to his roots.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy favourite memory of my time in Japan has to be the day he was born, which is quite a story.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was about two weeks before Michelle was due and her mother had come out early to stay with us.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI had just finished playing golf and someone at the club told me I had a call. It was Michelle and she said she thought she\'d started having contractions. I said: \"Right, I\'ll come straight home,\" but she said: \"No, no, you know it will take ages so don\'t rush.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nSo I had a bite to eat before heading home but when I got there, Michelle wasn\'t there, just her mum, with George. She said: \"She\'s had to go, it\'s all happened very quickly.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nI thought \"oh no\" and jumped in the car - it was about a 40-minute drive to the hospital and I thought I might have missed everything.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen I got there I was about to run inside when two nurses saw me and said: \"Lineker-san, Lineker-san, sutoppu, sutoppu!\" - telling me I had to stop.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nI was like, \"why sutoppu!?!\" and they said: \"Shoes!\" I went \"shoes?\", and they said, \"change shoes, put on slippers,\" so I rushed to put these slippers on and they were always too small in Japan, so I was awkwardly shuffling along while still moving as quickly as possible.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI made it to the maternity unit and there was a big glass door. I could hear Michelle behind it, screaming in agony in labour, so I went to go straight through? and some more nurses shouted \"Lineker-san, sutoppu, sutoppu!\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nAgain I asked: \"Sutoppu? Why sutoppu now?\" and they said: \"Slippers.\" I said: \"I\'ve got slippers!\" and they said: \"No, change slippers. Different slippers.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnyway I threw them on and dashed in and saw Michelle there and, less than 20 seconds later, the baby came out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAs a striker, you always have to time your run, you see, and I guess you never really lose it. I didn\'t do it very often in Japan, but I still managed it when it really mattered.', 'gary_linker.png', 'Sport', 0),

Rui Costa was the opposite - more gentle, more artistic in his football. For several seconds Materazzi put his elbow on the shoulder of Rui Costa.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"So when I saw that, I shot it. I have just one frame in that sequence. That was the moment.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe picture has its own legacy, but it also captured the end of AC Milan and Inter Milan\'s most recent Champions League match; a 2005 quarter-final that was abandoned after flares and other objects rained down on the San Siro turf from a section of Inter fans, one striking and injuring Milan goalkeeper Dida.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nWith 73 minutes played of the second leg, the referee abandoned the match and the tie was later awarded to Milan, who were leading 3-0 on aggregate.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The atmosphere that night was like every time you have an AC Milan and Inter derby at the San Siro,\" says Rellandini, who was working for Reuters at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It is always strong. They don\'t fight a lot, but the choreography of the supporters is huge and great, so you can really feel it, even if you\'re not a player.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"When you put your feet on to the pitch, you can feel that it\'s not just a soccer match. It is something more.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"You are really close to the players. It was a nice atmosphere; there was adrenaline.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"It just blew up when they disallowed the goal from Esteban Cambiasso. That completely changed the situation.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The Inter Milan supporters were freaking out. They started throwing down objects, flares, and did not stop for about 15 or 20 minutes. It was something like a war.\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nEventually, with objects still cascading down from the stands, both teams were ordered off the pitch, attempting to shelter as they escaped via a tunnel in the same corner of the ground as the ultras.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"After the first few flares lit up, the pitch was completely in the fog, so you couldn\'t see. Even if you wanted to catch a picture of someone injured, you couldn\'t,\" explains Rellandini, although he did manage to catch his masterpiece amid the chaos.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"They stopped the match for almost half an hour, which was strange at that time. You start to think that something bad has happened because they really threw down everything - they were getting crazy.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen the players returned, Dida - treated for first-degree burns to his shoulder - was replaced by Christian Abbiati, but after 30 seconds, with the barrage continuing, Merk was forced to abandon the fixture.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The referee took the right decision,\" said Maldini. \"I was surprised that he tried to restart the game but it was good because so many supporters had paid to watch.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nAncelotti, like Inter manager Roberto Mancini, condemned the incident, calling it a \"disgraceful episode\".\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"What happened will not just discredit Inter but all of the city,\" Ancelotti said. \"The reaction of the Inter fans was completely unexpected. I was really surprised because I have never seen something like that in all of the Milan derbies that I have taken part in.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilan police chief Paolo Scarpi blamed it on \"two to three hundred hooligans? the usual hotheads from the Inter section\", while Berlusconi, Italian prime minister at the time as well as Milan owner, suggested \"drastic measures\" were needed to stem the rise of violence at stadiums.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUefa, European football\'s governing body, handed Inter a ?132,000 fine and ordered them to play four European games behind closed doors.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\"This is the largest fine in Uefa\'s history. There will be some people who think it is lenient and some people who think it harsh,\" a Uefa spokesperson told the BBC.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilan went on to beat PSV Eindhoven on away goals in the semi-finals - Dida set a Champions League record of seven successive clean sheets in their 2-0 first-leg victory, before PSV won the return 3-1.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilan would have clinched a seventh European title but for a miracle in Istanbul in which Liverpool scored three times in six minutes in the final before winning on penalties.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilan would get their revenge two years later, seeing off Liverpool in the final in Athens, although on a domestic level their points deduction and Juventus\' relegation opened the door for a period of Inter dominance in Serie A.\r\n<br><br>\r\nInter were awarded the 2006 title then won four in a row, culminating in a Treble under Jose Mourinho in 2009-10.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNeither Milan side have reached the final since, but that will change this year after a semi-final derby that has also brought Rellandini\'s iconic image back to life.', 'champions_league.png', 'Sport', 0),

Gould personally made more than ?1.7m.\r\n<br>\r\nDirect subscribers paid ?10 a month to watch every Premier League game, compared with about ?80 a month for legal services from Sky, BT Sport and Amazon Prime.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case has highlighted a demand for illegal streaming, created by the unavailability of many football matches on TV.\r\n<br>\r\nUefa allows the Premier League to prevent broadcasts of UK matches between 14:45 and 17:15 on Saturdays.\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"blackout\", in place for decades, is to encourage fans to attend matches, at all levels of football, rather than watch on TV.\r\n<br>\r\nBut Flawless offered subscribers \"3pm kick-off\" Premier League games, otherwise broadcast only abroad.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the investigators raided the homes of gang members, they seized computer equipment and documents detailing the operation of Flawless.\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, they now have payment information for thousands of those who subscribed to the service.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Premier League pays the Federation Against Copyright Theft to investigate and enforce its copyright over football content.\r\n<br>\r\nFact visits those identified as using illegal football streaming, warning them they are potentially breaking the law, as well as issuing \"cease and desist\" letters to those running streams.\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seems highly unlikely fans will face legal action.\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the barristers who worked on the Flawless case, Ari Alibhai, said, in an online seminar, in 2021: \"In practice, the idea of someone being prosecuted who isn\'t also concerned in the trade, so they aren\'t also concerned in supplying illicit television services, is minimal.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fans thinking of subscribing to illegal streams could be setting themselves up for another headache.\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get sports and you are getting a cheap price,\" Mr Love says. \"But you\'re committing an offence and putting yourself in danger.\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are contributing to organised crime who won\'t be paying taxes and can make a quick buck by selling your details on.\"\r\n<br>\r\nThese could be used to steal money or hack computers. The streaming sites themselves are also riddled with malware and pornography.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProsecutors in the Flawless case described the lengths to which gangs would go to avoid detection, in a cat-and-mouse game between broadcasters and illegal streamers.\r\n<br>\r\nSky adds a code on screen during its broadcasts, which acts as a watermark, so it can determine which legitimate accounts are being used for offering illegal streaming.\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Flawless gang developed software to blur the watermark - and so Sky randomised its on-screen position to prevent that.\r\n<br>\r\nCovert \"test purchases\" and subscriptions are also used in the fight against copyright theft, helping the Premier League take down 590,000 streams in 2021.\r\n<br>\r\nBut it remains big business - and when Flawless was shut down, other services were quick to take over, amid complaints from users online.\r\n<br>\r\nThe investigation into the gang continues, with the aim of seizing the illegal money they made.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Premier League\'s legal team say they will now pursue other illegal streaming operators.\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Premier League\'s substantial financial contribution to the entire football pyramid is made possible through the ability to sell our broadcast rights,\" the league\'s general counsel, Kevin Plumb, said.\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are pleased that through rulings such as this, the courts continue to show that they recognise the importance of safeguarding the Premier League\'s rights.\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will continue to protect our rights and our fans by investigating and prosecuting illegal operators at all levels.\"', 'fraud_gang.png', 'Sport', 0);
